		<p class = "infoportion" style = "position:relative; left:60px; top:2px;">The Whooping Crane (Scientific Name: Grus Americana) is the tallest bird in North America. It is an endagered crane species and one of two crane species native to North America. With an estimated lifespan of 22-24 years, the whooping crane population had been pushed to the brink of extinction by 1941. There were only 21 wild and 2 captive whooping cranes remaining and conservation efforts have led to minimal recovery.</p>
